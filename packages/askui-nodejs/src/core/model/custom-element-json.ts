 * `await aui.click().button().withText('Submit').exec()`.
 *
 * **Important:** The `CustomElementJson` needs to capture as accurately as
 * possible what the custom element looks like during test execution as
 * otherwise our machine learning models cannot find it, even with the
 * additional data provided. This is especially true for the resolution used
 * while cropping the `CustomElementJson.customImage` which should be as
 * similar as possible to the resolution during test execution.
 *
 * Rotated custom elements can be filtered for using
 * `CustomElementJson.rotationDegreePerStep`.

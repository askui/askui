# icon

 <span class="theme-doc-version-badge badge badge--success">production</span> 
Filters for a UI element 'icon'.

You can combine it with the element-description 'withText()' to look for a specific icon.

**Examples:** 
```typescript
icon().withText('plus')
```

**Note:** This is an alpha feature. The prediction of the icon name is sometimes unstable. Use custom elements as an alternative.

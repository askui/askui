# icon

<span class="theme-doc-version-badge badge badge--secondary"></span>

Filters for an UI element 'icon'.

You can combine it with the 'withText' command to look for a specific icon.

**Examples:** 
```typescript
icon().withText('plus')
```

Note: This is an alpha feature. The prediction of the icon name is sometimes unstable. Use custom elements as an alternative.

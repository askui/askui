## Record Runs with AskUI Reporters
The AskUI Suite includes a framework, that allows you to receive data collected during your workflows' runs. To encourage this, we provide a toolkit that allows you to build connections between AskUI and your other tools.

There are already several pre-built reporters for you to choose from, but you can go further and make your own.

## Run AskUI Workflows in Your QA Pipeline
AskUI was designed with quality assurance professionals in mind. That's why everything is built on the jest framework, which lets you integrate AskUI into your QA process faster.

With our pipeline integration toolkit you can quickly set up workflows in your pipeline for a complete 360-degree view of your test runs.

## Your Own Device Farm with AskUI Runners
AskUI Runner gives you the ability to remotely carry out a workflow in QA on a local device. The runner receives instructions from AskUI Studio and carries them out, sending back a report after it is done.

# annotateInteractively

Creates an annotated version of your screen and shows it to you so you can explore the annotated image.
Recognized elements are annotated with a red bounding box.  You can copy the filter needed to select the element by left-clicking on the bounding box.

See also [the detailed explanation](../../general/05-Tooling/annotation.md#interactive-annotation) to see how you can use it to create instructions.

**Examples:**
```typescript 
await aui.annotateInteractively();
```

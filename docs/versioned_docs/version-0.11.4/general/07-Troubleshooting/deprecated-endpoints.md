# Deprecated Endpoints

If you are using the AskUI library you may see this warning:

`This endpoint will deprecate. Please upgrade your AskUI version`

This means that you are using an AskUI version, which will stop working in the near future. 

You can upgrade your AskUI version with the following command:

```shell
npm install askui@latest
```

If this does not work, try the following steps:

1. Delete your `node_modules` folder
2. Check the latest version of `askui` in your `package.json`
3 Run `npm install` to reinstall AskUI

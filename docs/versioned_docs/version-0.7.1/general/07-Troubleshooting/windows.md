## askui UI Controller 

On Windows, the askui UI Controller may not terminate after test execution. This may lead to problems when using the askui UI Controller in a pipeline like a pipeline's run not coming to an end.

In this case you can force termination of the askui UI Controller. The `UiController.stop()` takes an optional boolean argument which is set to `false` by default. If we pass `true` to the `UiController.stop()` method, e.g., `uiController.stop(true)`,  we kill the askui UI Controller process. 

```typescript
await uiController.stop(true);
```

If you are using the Jest framework to execute your test steps, you can also force Jest to exit as described on our [Jest-Troubleshooting page](jest.md). This option terminates all processes which were set up by test code and didn't close properly. The first option explicitly stops the askui UI Controller.

# AskUI on macOS

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16 or above
- __npm__ in version 7.10 or above (usually comes with the Node.js installation)
- A text editor/IDE like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

:::danger

Some users have reported instability running AskUI on macOS with external displays and/or [virtual desktops (called Spaces)](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh14112/mac). If you experience similar issues, please disconnect external displays and close virtual desktops, or see [documentation on running AskUI in Docker](../../05-Integrations/containers.md).

## Access Token

As we need to prevent misuse of our API, we need you to create some credentials through our __AskUI Studio__ (for free).

Please [fill out this form](https://xa5a040gvfz.typeform.com/to/Ndh2NkV6) to schedule a demonstration or [request a trial](https://xa5a040gvfz.typeform.com/to/IHdr0qY5) to obtain access to __AskUI Studio__.

## Installation

Open a directory where you would like to place the AskUI setup and run this command. The command will ask you a few questions on how to customize your setup. If you are unsure which value to select press the `Enter`-key to select the default value. Also keep your `workspace id` and your `access token` ready which you [created just before](#access-token) (We hope so ðŸ˜‰).

```shell
npx askui@latest init
```

:::note

To create and serve a static HTML-Report you have to install [Allure](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2#download) and then call `allure serve ./allure-results` from your root-directory.

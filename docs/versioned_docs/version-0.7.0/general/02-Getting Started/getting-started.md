# Installing askui

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16 or above
- [npm.js](https://www.npmjs.com/) version 7.10 or above
- :warning: **Linux**: [Information for Wayland](../07-Troubleshooting/linux.md#wayland).


## macOS

:::danger

Some users have reported instability running askui on macOS with external displays and/or [virtual desktops (called Spaces)](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh14112/mac). If you experience similar issues, please disconnect external displays and close virtual desktops, or see [documentation on running askui in Docker](../04-Continuous%20Integration/askui-ui-controller-docker-images.md).

:::

## Installation

Open a directory where you would like to place the askui setup. If you havenâ€™t already, set up an NPM project by running:

```shell
npm init -y
```

This will create a `package.json` file inside your present working directory which contains the configuration of your project including a description of its dependencies.

Install `askui` and other dependencies for writing and executing tests:

```shell
npm i -D askui typescript ts-node @types/jest ts-jest jest
```

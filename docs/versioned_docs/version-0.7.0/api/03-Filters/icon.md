# icon

Filters for an UI element 'icon'.

You can combine it with the 'withText' command to look for a specific icon.

**Examples:** 
```typescript
icon().withText('plus')
```

**Note:** This is an alpha feature. The prediction of the icon name is sometimes unstable. Use custom elements as an alternative.
